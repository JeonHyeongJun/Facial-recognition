# Real-Time Face Recognition and Emotion Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is an application that performs real-time face recognition and emotion analysis using a camera. It utilizes OpenCV for face detection and a simple logic-based approach for emotion analysis, classifying emotions as either 'Happy' or 'Neutral'.

## Packages and Versions
The following packages and their versions are required for this project:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV (for face recognition): `opencv-python`
- (Optional) Deep learning libraries and pretrained models for advanced emotion analysis

### Installation Instructions
To install the necessary packages, run the following commands:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
# Additional packages for deep learning-based models if used
